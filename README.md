# Protect Yourself Against Scammers

Over the past months, scammers have gotten more sophisticated. Always be on alert when you are transferring money take precautions:
 
* If anyone asks you for money, you should be very suspicious
* There are no “pump groups” or “VIP sections” of any projects
* Check the website as the best source of truth (and google the website to make sure you are going to the legitimate one)
* Never trust any address on a Slack, confirm it on the website (or with the email)!
* Only copy paste addresses by double tapping (do not manually type or click and dragging to highlight)
* Before you send money to anyone, double check it is the right address
* Never click on a suspicious link
* Whenever you talk to the team, double check that you are actually talking to the real person
